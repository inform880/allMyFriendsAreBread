This is a quick reference for those new to do it yourself media and streaming tools. I try to link to resources for each one (including any of my own posts) with a short description and what platforms it can run on, and organize it by category as best as I can. 

**live document, will be updated over time**

##### Kodi (formerly XBMC)
Kodi is a software app that runs on many different platforms and hardware, like Android, Raspberry Pi, Fire TVs, Windows, Mac. It's compatible with television screen sizes and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most streaming media, such as videos, music, podcasts, streaming platforms, and even TV antennas for live over-the-air broadcasts with the right hardware. It also can run games!
##### Plex
Plex is really two different things: There's the personal media server part that you store your media content on. You can then access using the regular Plex app to view that content on wherever you want. Most App stores you can download plex on are offering the part that lets you view content. A very important feature is that you can share your server library with other users.
##### Emby
Emby offers very similar features to Plex, but has no premium/paid tier and open sourced. It's arguably harder to setup and offers a less streamlined interface, which can make it harder for older folks and technically challenged people to use.
