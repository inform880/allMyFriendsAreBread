All my friends are sad right right now. Of course to varying degrees, but its still pretty remarkable how it feels like everyone I talk to feels this. It is the season for the blues, as it gets colder, and the sun sets before many even get home from a regular workday.
An old work aquaintance is stuck in a uncomfortable situation at work. A loved one's antidepressants don't seem to be working. A beloved friend is frustrated at a particular person for failing to show up. A complicated relationship hits a snag as a friend, a bit older than me, falls deeper into addiction. I could go on.
It's even more frustrating when you can't help, and unbearable when you're actually the cause somewhat.
Maybe sometime soon there'll be some relief in sight. At this point politics aren't even causing it, and in a lot of cases are providing an unhealthy distraction from the day to day woes, or in some cases simply survival, of many friends. I hope things get better soon for everyone, including myself. Certainly feels like we've come upon the beginning of the end times, but I'm sure a lot of people throughout history have felt that. The only thing I can offer to most is an empty, "it will get better", with a forced smile.
Who's gonna pull each other up when everyone is down?
