## Hi!

I'm a software engineer who's been around the block a few times, focusing mostly on frontend and some full stack development. I've got a solid history of taking charge and getting tough projects done in all kinds of different places. I'm always down for a collaborating on something new, though!

I enjoy developing applications in my free time, along with socializing with my friends, and my cat Ryuu.
