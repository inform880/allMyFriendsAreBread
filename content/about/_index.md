I'm a software engineer who's been around the block a few times, focusing mostly on frontend and some full stack development. I've got a solid history of taking charge and getting tough projects done in all kinds of different places.

I enjoy programming in my free time, along with socializing with my friends and my cat Ryuu.

I'm always down for a collaborating, given I have the time!
